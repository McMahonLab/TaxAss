RRR 8-27-15

This script creates a list of all the seqIDs in your .fasta file.
Then it creates a list of all the seqIDs in your .blast.table file.
The script then identifies all seqIDs missing from the blast.table file and
appends them to the below-cutoff seqID file
that was generated by the R script find_seqIDs_with_pident.R

The format for typing into the terminal is:

$ python find_seqIDs_blast_removed.py otus.fasta otus.custom.blast.table.modified ids.missing

where
		fastafile		otus.fasta is the path to the fasta file containing all the seqIDs
		blastfile		otus.custom.blast.table.modified is the path to the blast results in table format (col1 = seqID)				
		outputfile		ids.missing is the path to the file with below-cutoff seqID file generated by the R script find_seqIDs_with_pident.R

Acknowledgements: I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Josh Hamilton for his invaluable aid
in troubleshooting this script.
